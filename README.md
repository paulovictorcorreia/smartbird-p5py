# Smartbird

In this repository, there is the code of a neuroevolution flappybird, which uses genetic algorithm and 
neural networks to make the bird learn how to beat the game. There will be a player script and a genetic algorithm script
to learn to play the game.


To run the player version, enter the sketches directory and run:
 ` python flappybird.py `

Also, to make bird jump, just press space bar. When the bird dies, click on the screen.

Also, this project is based on [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6y21FkaUqw)'s video of neuroevolution algorithm, shoutout to [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/CodingTrain) and his amazing job teaching programming!
